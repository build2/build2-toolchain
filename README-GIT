This project is essentially a collection of other projects organized as git
submodules. Some of those projects also use submodules. As a result, things
can get "non-trivial", to put it mildly. Make sure you have good grasp of git
submodules before doing anything here (even cloning this project requires
special steps). In particular, make sure you have read on submodules in the
git/cheatsheet.txt file.

A few additional notes:

1. This project is not automatically updated by the modup script since you
   normally need to update and commit member projects before updating here.
   So normally the procedure is:

   ./modup
   ./commit
   ./push
   cd build2-toolchain
   git submodule update --remote
   git submodule foreach git submodule update --init --recursive
   git ci -a

   The foreach command updates submodules (if any) of member projects to the
   commits that were "fetched" by the previous command. Failed that, you will
   see the '(new commits, modified content)' status instead of just '(new
   commits)' next to submodules (i.e., git "thinks" you have modified the
   member project by "setting back" its subproject commit).
